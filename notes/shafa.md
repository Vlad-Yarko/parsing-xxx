## Pagination
- Shafa has query param **page**
- To load all images need to be scrolled down to bottom
- When page is gone Shafa lets you be on the page with set **page** param from you but no products are on page.
- I noticed that paginator element disappeared - it can be useful

## Filters
- All filters are query params
- Every category has its own filters
- Every category is path param and even params
- There are double categories maybe even triple
- Search text is in **search_text** query param
- Also category can be universal
__examples__:
```

```
